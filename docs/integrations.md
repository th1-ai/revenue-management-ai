# Connecting your systems

Every connector in this repo is one of three things, and the table says which.
We will not tell you an integration exists when it does not.

| Badge | Means |
|---|---|
| **built** | Written against the real API and tested against it. |
| **universal** | Works with any system through a common protocol: IMAP/SMTP, CSV, a webhook. |
| **stub** | Interface only. Calling it raises a clear error with a recipe for adding it. |

Check what is actually working on your machine at any time:

```bash
make doctor
```

**What Revenue Management AI actually uses.** Only two of the four adapters
below: **PMS** (reads capacity and on-the-books reservations; writes an
approved rate) and **Sheets** (writes an approved stay-rule change, since
there is no shared PMS primitive for one — see "Signals this agent needs"
below). It does not use Email or Messaging at all — this agent has no guest
inbox and sends no messages. `pos`, `accounting`, `reviews`, `calendar`,
`payments`, `procurement` and `locks` are unused stubs, same as every repo
in this family.

## Status

### PMS - `systems.pms.adapter`

| Adapter | Status | Needs | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mock` | universal | nothing | Reads `fixtures/hotel/*.json`. What `make demo` uses. |
| `csv` | universal | a CSV export | Reads `data/imports/*.csv`. **Start here.** Works with every PMS. |
| `cloudbeds` | built | OAuth app + refresh token | Live reads and writes. |
| `cli` | universal | a JSON-speaking CLI | Advanced. Bridges to a vendor command line tool. |

**`csv` - the one that always works.** Export from your PMS and drop the files in
`data/imports/`:

- `reservations.csv` - `id, status, check_in, check_out, room_type_id,
  room_type_name, room_id, adults, children, source, total, balance, currency,
  guest_email, guest_first_name, guest_last_name, guest_phone, guest_country`
- `guests.csv` - `id, first_name, last_name, email, phone, country, language, vip`
- `rooms.csv` - `id, name, max_occupancy, count, rank`
- `rates.csv` - `date, room_type_id, price, currency, min_los, available, closed`

Headers are matched loosely: `checkIn`, `check_in` and `Check In` all work, and
extra columns are kept. Dates must be `YYYY-MM-DD`. Only `reservations.csv` is
required; the rest add capability.

In CSV mode the agent cannot write back to your PMS, so anything it wants to
change is appended to `data/exports/pms_writes.csv` with everything a person
needs to apply it by hand. That is a feature: it is how you check the agent's
judgement before you give it write access.

**`cloudbeds`.** Create an app in the Cloudbeds developer portal, authorise it
once against your property, and put the result in `.env`:

```
CLOUDBEDS_CLIENT_ID=
CLOUDBEDS_CLIENT_SECRET=
CLOUDBEDS_REFRESH_TOKEN=
CLOUDBEDS_PROPERTY_ID=
```

Scopes: `read:reservation`, `write:reservation`, `read:guest`, `read:room`,
`read:rate`, `write:rate`, `read:hotel`. The access token refreshes itself.

**`cli`.** If your PMS already has a command line tool that prints JSON, point at
it. See the profiles at the top of `core/adapters/pms_cli.py`.

### Email - `systems.email.adapter`

| Adapter | Status | Needs | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mock` | universal | nothing | Reads `fixtures/inbound/*.eml` and `*.json`. |
| `imap` | universal | mailbox + app password | Any provider. **Start here.** |
| `gmail` | built | Google OAuth desktop client | Adds Gmail labels and threads. |

**`imap`.** In `.env`:

```
EMAIL_ADDRESS=reservations@example.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=            # an APP password, never your login password
IMAP_HOST=imap.example.com
SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
SMTP_PORT=587              # 587 STARTTLS, 465 implicit TLS
```

Google, Microsoft and Fastmail all issue app-specific passwords. Two-factor stays
on and you can revoke the password without touching the account.

Replies carry `In-Reply-To` and `References`, so they land inside the guest's
existing thread rather than starting a new one.

**`gmail`.** Google Cloud Console: enable the Gmail API, configure the consent
screen, create an OAuth client of type **Desktop app**, download the JSON to
`credentials.json`. Then `pip install google-api-python-client google-auth-oauthlib`
and run `make doctor`; a browser opens once and writes `token.json`. Scopes:
`gmail.readonly`, `gmail.send`, `gmail.modify`.

### Messaging - `systems.messaging.adapter`

| Adapter | Status | Needs | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mock` | universal | nothing | Reads `fixtures/inbound/messages.json`. |
| `unipile` | built | your own UniPile account | WhatsApp on your own number. |
| `webhook` | universal | any URL | POST to Zapier, Make, n8n, or your own endpoint. |

**`unipile`.** You create the account, you connect your number by QR code, you
own the credentials: `UNIPILE_DSN`, `UNIPILE_API_KEY`, `UNIPILE_ACCOUNT_ID`.
WhatsApp Business policy limits what you may send outside a guest-initiated
window; read your provider's rules before turning this on.

**`webhook`.** The simplest possible outbound: set `MESSAGING_WEBHOOK_URL` and
the agent POSTs `{chat_id, text, kind, hotel, sent_at}`. Your automation tool
delivers it however you like. Send-only.

### Sheets - `systems.sheets.adapter`

| Adapter | Status | Needs | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `csv` | universal | nothing | Writes `data/exports/<sheet>.csv`. |
| `google` | built | service account JSON | A live shared spreadsheet. |

For `google`: enable the Sheets API, create a service account and a JSON key,
save it as `service_account.json`, and share your spreadsheet with the service
account's email address as an Editor. Set `systems.sheets.spreadsheet_id` to the
long id from the sheet's URL.

### Everything else

`pos`, `accounting`, `reviews`, `calendar`, `payments`, `procurement` and `locks`
are **stubs**: the interface exists, nothing is implemented. Calling one raises an
error that tells you exactly this. If your agent needs one, use the recipe below.

## Signals this agent needs, with no adapter

Pickup pace, competitor rates, local events/weather, and (for the
Cartographer) OTA-observed rates and content findings are not things any
common PMS, email, messaging or sheets API exposes — there is no shared
adapter family for "a rate shopper" or "an events feed" the way there is for
a mailbox. Rather than pretend one exists, `tools/ingest.py` reads them
straight from CSV — the same **universal** pattern as `core/adapters/pms_csv.py`,
just without inventing a new adapter class. Each one falls back to the
matching `fixtures/inbound/*.json` file when the CSV is absent, which is
what `make demo` reads.

| File | Columns | Feeds |
|---|---|---|
| `data/imports/pace.csv` | `date, room_type_id, pace_vs_ly_pts` | pickup pace vs last year — defaults to `0` (neutral) for any cell you have not supplied |
| `data/imports/comp_rates.csv` | `date, competitor, rate_multiplier, room_type_id` (blank = every room type), `note` | the comp-set median, the event/forecast rate-shopping panel |
| `data/imports/events.csv` | `name, kind, category, start_date, end_date, note` — `category: event` (`kind: congress\|regatta\|low_demand`) or `category: weather` (`kind: rain\|sunny`) | event radar, MLOS, the weather-signal forecast (never repricing — see `docs/how-it-works.md` "Guardrails") |
| `data/imports/ota_rates.csv` | `channel, date, room_type_id, observed_rate` | the Cartographer's parity check (real comparison, not an asserted status) |
| `data/imports/ota_content_findings.csv` | `channel, kind, detail, severity` — `kind: photos\|description\|amenities\|inconsistency`, `severity: high\|medium` | the Cartographer's content-health score and fix drafts |

`make doctor`'s "signal sources" line shows which file each one is actually
reading from, or whether it is defaulting to neutral/empty. A rate-shopping
tool (Lighthouse, OTA Insight class) or an events service (PredictHQ class)
that can export or schedule a CSV drop into `data/imports/` plugs in with no
code changes at all.

## Implement your own

<a id="implement-your-own"></a>

The interface is small on purpose, and your Claude Code session can do this with
you in an afternoon. Open `claude` in this folder and paste:

> Read `docs/integrations.md#implement-your-own` and `core/adapters/base.py`.
> I need a PMS adapter for **<your system>**. Its API docs are at **<url>** and
> I have credentials in `.env` as `<VAR names>`. Copy `core/adapters/pms_csv.py`
> as the shape, implement `ping`, `capabilities` and the read methods first,
> register it in `core/adapters/__init__.py`, and stop before the write methods
> so I can check the reads with `make doctor`.

### The five steps

**1. Copy the closest existing adapter.**
`core/adapters/pms_csv.py` for a PMS, `email_imap.py` for a mailbox,
`messaging_webhook.py` for a chat channel. They are short and heavily commented.

**2. Implement `ping()` and `capabilities()` first.**

```python
def ping(self) -> HealthCheck:
    """Never raises. Returns ok=False with a fix_hint a hotel can act on."""

def capabilities(self) -> set[str]:
    """The method names that actually do something on this adapter."""
```

`make doctor` reads both. Getting them right first means the rest of the work has
a feedback loop.

**3. Implement the reads.** Map the vendor's fields onto the dataclasses in
`core/adapters/base.py` (`Reservation`, `Guest`, `RoomType`, `RateRow`,
`EmailMessage`, `ChatMessage`). Put anything you do not map into `.extra` rather
than dropping it. Dates are ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`. Money is a float in the hotel's
currency.

**4. Implement the writes, each with the guard.**

```python
from core.adapters.base import guarded_write

@guarded_write("pms_write")
def add_note(self, reservation_id: str, text: str) -> dict:
    ...
```

The decorator is not optional. Without it your adapter can write while the agent
is in shadow mode, which defeats the entire safety model. The action name should
be one of the values in `review.require_approval_for`.

**5. Register it.** One line in `core/adapters/__init__.py`:

```python
REGISTRY["pms"]["yoursystem"] = "core.adapters.pms_yoursystem:YourSystemPMS"
```

Then set `systems.pms.adapter: yoursystem` in `config/hotel.yaml` and run
`make doctor`.

### Rules that matter

- **`ping()` never raises.** It returns `HealthCheck(ok=False, ...)` with a hint.
  A broken adapter must still produce a readable doctor table.
- **Every write is decorated.** No exceptions.
- **Rate limits belong in the adapter.** Use `core/adapters/_http.py:RateLimiter`.
  Retry 429 and 5xx with backoff; never retry a 4xx.
- **Never log a credential.** `core/log.py` masks anything whose key looks like a
  secret, but do not rely on it.
- **Redact on ingestion.** Any guest-written text goes through
  `core.redact.redact()` before it is stored or shown to a model.
- **Write a test.** Copy `tests/test_core_adapters_mock_csv.py`. It should run
  with no network: feed your parser a fixture, check the dataclass that comes out.

### `core/` is shared

`core/` is identical in all 28 agents in this family. If you change something in
`core/`, keep it generic - a hotel-specific tweak belongs in `tools/` or in your
own adapter file, not in the shared runtime.
